We wanted to create a tool that makes it easy for everyone to understand and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\n### What it does\n\nEcoTrack AI uses machine learning to analyze daily activities, transportation choices, and consumption patterns to calculate accurate carbon emissions. It then provides personalized, actionable recommendations to reduce environmental impact.\n\n### How we built it\n\nWe used React Native for the mobile app, Python with TensorFlow for the ML models, and Firebase for backend services. The carbon calculation algorithms are based on EPA and IPCC data.\n\n### Challenges we faced\n\nGetting accurate carbon emission data across different countries was challenging. We also struggled with making the ML model work efficiently on mobile devices.\n\n### What we learned\n\nWe learned about carbon accounting, optimization techniques for mobile ML, and the importance of user-friendly design for environmental apps.",

The adaptive learning system uses reinforcement learning.\n\n### Challenges we faced\n\nHandling different accents and speech patterns was challenging. We also had to create a curriculum that feels natural rather than scripted.\n\n### What we learned\n\nWe learned about speech processing, conversational AI design, and educational psychology principles for effective language acquisition.",

We wanted to create a tool that makes learning algorithms intuitive and engaging.\n\n### What it does\n\nAlgoMaster provides interactive visualizations for common algorithms and data structures. Users can step through executions, adjust input data, and see how different algorithms compare in performance.\n\n### How we built it\n\nWe used React with D3.js for visualizations, implemented algorithm executors in JavaScript, and added real-time performance metrics.\n\n### Challenges we faced\n\nCreating smooth animations while maintaining accuracy was challenging. We also had to balance educational value with visual appeal.\n\n### What we learned\n\nWe learned about algorithm analysis, animation techniques, and educational interface design.",
